# Complete Financial Management System - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Unified Approval System (Admin/Client)
**Agar koi aik bi kardeta hai approve - status sab jagah update hota hai**

#### How it Works:
- ‚úÖ **Admin approves POD** ‚Üí Status updates for Admin, Client, AND Transporter
- ‚úÖ **Client approves POD** ‚Üí Status updates for Admin, Client, AND Transporter  
- ‚úÖ **Admin approves Invoice** ‚Üí Status updates for Admin, Client, AND Transporter
- ‚úÖ **Client approves Invoice** ‚Üí Status updates for Admin, Client, AND Transporter

#### Backend Changes:

**`workspace/backend/src/routes/pods.ts`**
- **Admin approval** (`PUT /api/pods/:id/status`):
  - Sets main `status` to APPROVED/REJECTED
  - Also sets `clientApprovalStatus` to CLIENT_APPROVED (unified)
  - Stores `adminApprovedBy` and `adminApprovedAt`
  - Notifies ALL parties via WebSocket

- **Client approval** (`PUT /api/pods/:id/client-review`):
  - Sets main `status` to APPROVED/REJECTED (unified)
  - Sets `clientApprovalStatus` to CLIENT_APPROVED/REJECTED
  - Stores `clientApprovedBy` and `clientReviewedAt`
  - Notifies ALL parties via WebSocket

**`workspace/backend/src/routes/invoices.ts`**
- **Admin approval** (`PUT /api/invoices/:id/status`):
  - Updates main `status`
  - Also sets `clientApprovalStatus` (unified)
  - Stores `adminApprovedBy` and `adminApprovedAt`
  - Notifies ALL parties via WebSocket

- **Client approval** (`PUT /api/invoices/:id/client-review`):
  - Updates main `status` (unified)
  - Sets `clientApprovalStatus`
  - Stores `clientApprovedBy` and `clientReviewedAt`
  - Notifies ALL parties via WebSocket

#### Real-time Updates:
```typescript
// When approval happens, ALL users get notified instantly:
io.to(`user_${transporterId}`).emit('pod_status_updated', { pod, approvedBy: 'admin' });
io.to(`user_${clientId}`).emit('pod_status_updated', { pod, approvedBy: 'admin' });
io.emit('pod_updated', { pod, approvedBy: 'admin' });
```
