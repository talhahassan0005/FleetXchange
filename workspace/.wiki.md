# Project Summary
FleetXchange is a logistics platform aimed at enhancing freight operations across Africa by connecting clients with transporters. It features three primary portals: the Admin Portal for managing users and reports, the Client Portal for posting loads and managing bids, and the Transporter Portal for browsing available loads. The platform includes functionalities such as user registration, document verification, and a real-time messaging system, all of which contribute to improved operational efficiency and user experience. FleetXchange has transitioned from a frontend-only application utilizing localStorage to a comprehensive, production-ready solution with a robust backend infrastructure.

# Project Module Description
- **Admin Portal**: Manages user accounts, document verification, load tracking, and advanced reporting analytics.
- **Client Portal**: Allows clients to post loads, manage bids, and access performance dashboards.
- **Transporter Portal**: Enables transporters to browse loads, submit bids, and view performance metrics.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js server with PostgreSQL database, RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, and real-time features using Socket.io.
- **File Upload**: Handles document uploads and manages verification tracking.
