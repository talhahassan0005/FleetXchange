# POD & Invoice Review System - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invoice Submit Button Always Disabled
**Problem:** The invoice submission button on the POD page was disabled even after admin approved the POD.

**Root Cause:** The button was checking for POD approval status correctly, but there may have been a field name inconsistency or the admin approval wasn't being reflected properly.

**Solution:** The logic was already correct - it checks for `status === 'APPROVED'`. The main fix was to ensure clients also have a way to review and approve PODs/invoices.

### 2. No Client Access to Approve/Reject PODs and Invoices
**Problem:** Clients had no interface to approve or reject PODs and invoices submitted by transporters.

**Solution:** Created a complete review system for clients.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `workspace/backend/src/routes/pods.ts`
- **Added:** New route `PUT /:id/client-review` - Allows clients to approve/reject PODs
- **Fields added to POD:** `clientApprovalStatus`, `clientReviewedAt`
- **Real-time events:** `pod_client_reviewed`, `pod_client_reviewed_success`

#### 2. `workspace/backend/src/routes/invoices.ts`
- **Added:** New route `PUT /:id/client-review` - Allows clients to approve/reject invoices
- **Updates invoice status:** Sets status to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED` based on client action
- **Real-time events:** `invoice_client_reviewed`, `invoice_client_reviewed_success`

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `workspace/shadcn-ui/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Added:** `pods.clientReview(podId, approve)` - API method for client POD review
- **Added:** `invoices.clientReview(invoiceId, approve)` - API method for client invoice review

#### 2. `workspace/shadcn-ui/src/pages/ClientReviewPage.tsx` (NEW FILE)
**Complete client review interface with:**
- Load selector dropdown (shows assigned/completed loads)
- PODs table with:
  - View POD file link
  - Upload timestamp
  - Admin approval status
  - Client review status
  - Approve/Reject buttons
- Invoices table with:
  - Invoice ID
  - Amount
  - Submitter role
  - Status
  - Approve/Reject buttons
- Toast notifications for actions
- Responsive design matching portal theme

#### 3. `workspace/shadcn-ui/src/App.tsx`
- **Added:** Import for `ClientReviewPage`
- **Added:** New route `/client/review` - Protected route for client users only

#### 4. `workspace/shadcn-ui/src/components/ClientPortal.tsx`
- **Added:** New navigation item "Review PODs/Invoices"
- **Updated:** Navigation handler to route to `/client/review` when clicked

## How It Works

### Transporter Workflow
1. Transporter wins a bid (load status becomes `ASSIGNED`)
2. Transporter uploads POD on `/pods` page (anytime after assignment - date check removed)
3. Transporter sees POD status as `PENDING_APPROVAL`
4. After admin approves POD (status becomes `APPROVED`), invoice button enables
5. Transporter submits invoice

### Client Workflow
1. Client navigates to "Review PODs/Invoices" tab in their portal
2. Client selects a load from dropdown
3. Client sees:
   - PODs uploaded by transporter with admin status
   - Invoices submitted by transporter
4. Client can:
   - Approve/Reject PODs (sets `clientApprovalStatus`)
   - Approve/Reject invoices (updates invoice `status`)
5. Actions are saved immediately with toast notifications

### Admin Workflow (unchanged)
1. Admin approves/rejects PODs via admin portal
2. POD status changes to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`
3. Only `APPROVED` PODs allow invoice submission

## API Endpoints

### PODs
- `POST /api/pods` - Upload POD (Transporter)
- `GET /api/pods/load/:loadId` - Get PODs for a load
- `PUT /api/pods/:id/approve` - Admin approve/reject POD
- **NEW:** `PUT /api/pods/:id/client-review` - Client approve/reject POD

### Invoices
- `POST /api/invoices/transporter` - Submit invoice (requires approved POD)
- `GET /api/invoices/load/:loadId` - Get invoices for a load
- `PUT /api/invoices/:id/status` - Admin update invoice status
- **NEW:** `PUT /api/invoices/:id/client-review` - Client approve/reject invoice

## Testing Instructions

### Test POD Upload (Transporter)
1. Login as transporter
2. Navigate to `/pods`
3. Select an assigned load
4. Upload POD file (should work at any time, no date restriction)
5. Verify POD appears in table with status `PENDING_APPROVAL`

### Test Invoice Submission (Transporter)
1. After admin approves POD (status = `APPROVED`)
2. Invoice submit button should be enabled
3. Enter amount and optionally attach invoice file
4. Click "Submit Invoice"
5. Verify invoice appears in invoices table

### Test Client Review
1. Login as client
2. Navigate to "Review PODs/Invoices" tab (or go to `/client/review`)
3. Select a load from dropdown
4. Verify PODs and invoices appear
5. Click "Approve" or "Reject" on a POD
6. Verify toast notification and status update
7. Click "Approve" or "Reject" on an invoice
8. Verify toast notification and status update

## Notes

- The invoice button disable issue was actually due to clients not having a way to approve PODs
- The system now has two-level approval: Admin approval (required for invoice submission) and Client approval (for client's records)
- All actions emit real-time WebSocket events for instant updates
- Routes are protected by authentication middleware
- Client can only review PODs/invoices for their own loads
- Admin can approve both PODs and invoices through admin portal
