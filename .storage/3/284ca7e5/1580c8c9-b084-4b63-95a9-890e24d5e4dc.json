The platform needs three main portals:\n\n1. Admin Portal - Approve/reject registrations for clients, transporters, trucks, and drivers. Manage document verification including company registration certificates, shareholders extract, directors' IDs, bank confirmation letters, application letters, VAT certificates, import documents, tax clearance, signed KYC forms for clients & transporters. For trucks: blue book copy, lease agreements, trailer documents. For drivers: valid driver's license, medical certificate (12 months), police clearance. Monitor posted loads and active bids. Provide simple reporting on users, verified documents, loads posted/completed.\n\n2. Client Portal - Register and upload company documents for verification. Post load requests with cargo details, pickup & delivery locations, tonnage, budget. View and select bids from transporters. Direct messaging system with transporters for specific loads. Dashboard to track load status and assigned transporters.\n\n3. Transporter Portal - Register and upload company, truck, and driver documents for verification. View available loads and place bids with price and truck availability. View bid results (won/lost). Assign verified truck and driver for won bids. Direct messaging system with clients for posted loads.\n\nMVP Priorities: User registration & document verification, load posting & bidding system, messaging portal (basic text-only per load/bid), simplified dashboards for each portal.\n\nInclude competitive analysis of similar logistics platforms, market research on freight management systems, user personas for admins/clients/transporters, technical requirements for document management and verification workflows, and detailed feature specifications.", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": false, "assignee": "Emma", "start_at": 1758647127.625917}, {"task_id": "2", "dependent_task_ids": ["1"], "instruction": "Design a comprehensive system architecture for the FleetXchange platform based on the PRD.
