### Original Requirements Restatement
FleetXchange is a comprehensive logistics platform that connects clients (cargo owners) with transporters through a three-portal system: Admin Portal for registration approvals and document verification, Client Portal for load posting and transporter selection, and Transporter Portal for bidding on available loads. The platform prioritizes user verification, load management, bidding systems, and direct communication between stakeholders.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals

1. **Streamline Freight Operations**: Create an efficient digital marketplace that reduces the time and complexity of connecting cargo owners with verified transporters through automated matching and bidding systems.

2. **Ensure Compliance and Trust**: Implement comprehensive document verification and KYC processes to maintain regulatory compliance and build trust among all platform participants through verified credentials.

3. **Optimize Cost and Transparency**: Provide transparent pricing through competitive bidding while offering real-time tracking and communication tools to reduce operational costs and improve service delivery.
